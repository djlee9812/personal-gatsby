Two things I've been thinking about recently: my professional/career interests, and religion

Doing research seems to require to some degree, knowing what you want to do and what you're passionate about.
I applied to graduate school wanting to study aerospace engineering and design airplanes, but I never thought
more specifically than that. I've done a wide range of projects, internships, and researches as UROPS, 
and I can't say I really disliked any of them. More than anything, I think I enjoy learning new things...
