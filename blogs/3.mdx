I recently updated this site with a new design and up to date information.

## Design Philosophy

The old design followed a typical Bootstrap layout common ten years ago.
I wanted to move away from the traditional full-screen hero image and explore a cleaner, more modern, minimalist aesthetic. The new design focuses on:

- **Bold Typography:** Using large, impactful headings.
- **Generous Whitespace:** Giving content room to breathe.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Automatically adapting to system preferences.
- **Card Layouts:** Organizing hobbies and projects into a clean grid.

## Tech Stack Changes

- **Gatsby & React:** Still the core of the site.
- **Framer Motion:** Added for smooth scroll animations and entrance effects.
- **CSS Modules:** Refactored for better modularity and type safety.
- **React Simple Maps** Replaced the static map with an interactive one, coloring visited countries and states dynamically from JSON data.

## AI Usage

With the website redesign, I wanted to explore and understand the capabilities of CLI-based AI tools for coding. While I have access to Copilot and Sourcegraph Cody 
(similar to Cursor) at work, these tools are limited in that they require explicit @-context, which essentially functions like copy-pasting entire code files into the 
context window. 

In contrast, CLI-based tools can interact with files by using shell commands to search, edit, and manage files, or curl to interact with the web.
This is a much more powerful way of writing code, improving productivity. I think becoming familiarized with these workflows will be crucial to avoiding obsolescence 
in the coming years. 

I plan to further explore these AI capabilities as I continue updating this site and working on other projects.
